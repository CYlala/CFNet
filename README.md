Figure 1: Our network project, named CFNet, is a deep learning endeavor focused on segmenting brain tumors in MRI images. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to merge multiple MRI sequences and automatically identify and segment tumor regions. We pair these modalities and input them into two independent but structurally identical encoders. Additionally, we introduce a Modality-Cross Attention Fusion Module to integrate features from multiple modalities. Furthermore, we propose a Multi-scale Context Perception Module to enhance feature semantic perception.
